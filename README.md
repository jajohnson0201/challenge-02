## Description

- Goal with this page was to start with nothing and take what we learned in advanced 
HTML + CSS and create a Portfolio for future jobs and proof that we understood what we've been learning!
- This was made from scratch, the only tools available were past lectures and resources and
(extensive) help from the Teacher, TA's, and also classmates were a huge help!
- This made the webpage available for us as students to use in the future with jobs and overall having the know-how!
- I learned that it is possible to start with nothing and make something of it, this was a great excersize of skills
and a useful tool to refer back to on future projects!
